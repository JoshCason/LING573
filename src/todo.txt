Current Flow

1. Assume that AQUAINT index is built as we will do some searching against it down the line (takes about ~2.5 min, index size ~820mb)
python2.7 aquaint_index.py

2. Take the TREC question XML file and output D2.outputs
python2.7 D2.py /dropbox/12-13/573/Data/Questions/training/TREC-2005.xml
