Current Flow

1. Assume that AQUAINT index is built as we will do some searching against it down the line (takes about ~2.5 min, index size ~820mb)
python2.7 aquaint_index.py

2. Take the TREC question XML file and output D2.outputs
python2.7 D2.py /dropbox/12-13/573/Data/Questions/training/TREC-2005.xml


TODO:

We want to combine some processes here, so we need to have web2candidates for each question not only 
retrieve web results but also do a search against the AQUAINT index (as seen in aquaint_search.py)
The results of both searches can then be evaluated and reranked based on the web results and the top N 
answers be outputted to D2.outputs in the correct format. 

Do we even need to bother storing web results for questions in lucene? I can see using it as a cache if 
the question is asked again, but I don't think it is completely necessary for a working system. Perhaps 
I am wrong. If so, let me know.
